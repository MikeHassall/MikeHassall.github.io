    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>My name is Michael Hassall and I have been coding for over 20 years in a variety of languages.</p>
    <p>My intention for this site is to keep track of my code and hopefully provide scripts that will be educational for
        others.</p>
    <h3>Square Breathing (javascript)</h3>
    <p>After a visit to the doctor to help with anxiety in the family, I learnt about the square breathing technique.</p>
    <p>I am a visual person so I found that keeping track of the time and stage worked well using a box. I went for a colour scheme using wellness colours.</p>
